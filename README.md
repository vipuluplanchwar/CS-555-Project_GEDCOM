# CS-555-Project_GEDCOM
This is the repository for the GEDCOM Parser Project for the course 'Agile Methods for Software Development (CS 555)'

A GEDCOM File(.ged) is a database file with its own unique format and is used for storing Genealogical data. The purpose of the GEDCOM Parser is to parse and read the .ged file, and validate its data for accuracy. This Project is a Team Project and the names of the Team Members are:

- Kunal Dhaimade
- Vipulkumar Uplanchwar
- 

The programming language chosen for this purpose by the Team is Python.

The initial file is a Python file named 'CS555_Proj2.py' which reads the .ged file and prints each line, followed by the level number of the GEDCOM format for that line, followed by the Tag of the GEDCOM format for that specific line.
